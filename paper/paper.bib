    abstract = {We describe a simple, efficient, robust and fully automatic algorithm for the determination of a multi-Gaussian expansion (MGE) fit to galaxy images, to be used as a parametrization for the galaxy stellar surface brightness. In most cases the least-squares solution found by this method essentially corresponds to the minimax, constant relative error, MGE approximation of the galaxy surface brightness, with the chosen number of Gaussians. The algorithm is well suited to be used with multiple-resolution images (e.g. Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and ground-based images). It works orders of magnitude faster and is more accurate than currently available methods. An alternative, more computing-intensive, fully linear algorithm that is guaranteed to converge to the smallest χ2 solution is also discussed. Examples of MGE fits are presented for objects with HST or ground-based photometry, including galaxies with significant isophote twist.},

title = {Imfit: a fast, flexible new program for astronomical image fitting},
journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
abstract = {I describe a new, open-source astronomical image-fitting program called imfit, specialized for galaxies but potentially useful for other sources, which is fast, flexible, and highly extensible. A key characteristic of the program is an object-oriented design that allows new types of image components (two-dimensional surface-brightness functions) to be easily written and added to the program. Image functions provided with imfit include the usual suspects for galaxy decompositions (Sérsic, exponential, Gaussian), along with Core-Sérsic and broken-exponential profiles, elliptical rings, and three components that perform line-of-sight integration through three-dimensional luminosity–density models of disks and rings seen at arbitrary inclinations. Available minimization algorithms include Levenberg–Marquardt, Nelder–Mead simplex, and Differential Evolution, allowing trade-offs between speed and decreased sensitivity to local minima in the fit landscape. Minimization can be done using the standard χ2 statistic (using either data or model values to estimate per-pixel Gaussian errors, or else user-supplied error images) or Poisson-based maximum-likelihood statistics; the latter approach is particularly appropriate for cases of Poisson data in the low-count regime. I show that fitting low-signal-to-noise ratio galaxy images using χ2 minimization and individual-pixel Gaussian uncertainties can lead to significant biases in fitted parameter values, which are avoided if a Poisson-based statistic is used; this is true even when Gaussian read noise is present.}

    abstract = {We present ProFit, a new code for Bayesian two-dimensional photometric galaxy profile modelling. ProFit consists of a low-level c++ library (libprofit), accessible via a command-line interface and documented API, along with high-level r (ProFit) and python (PyProFit) interfaces (available at github.com/ICRAR/libprofit, github.com/ICRAR/ProFit, and github.com/ICRAR/pyprofit, respectively). r ProFit is also available pre-built from cran; however, this version will be slightly behind the latest GitHub version. libprofit offers fast and accurate two-dimensional integration for a useful number of profiles, including Sérsic, Core-Sérsic, broken-exponential, Ferrer, Moffat, empirical King, point-source, and sky, with a simple mechanism for adding new profiles. We show detailed comparisons between libprofit and galfit. libprofit is both faster and more accurate than galfit at integrating the ubiquitous Sérsic profile for the most common values of the Sérsic index n (0.5 \&lt; n \&lt; 8). The high-level fitting code ProFit is tested on a sample of galaxies with both SDSS and deeper KiDS imaging. We find good agreement in the fit parameters, with larger scatter in best-fitting parameters from fitting images from different sources (SDSS versus KiDS) than from using different codes (ProFit versus galfit). A large suite of Monte Carlo-simulated images are used to assess prospects for automated bulge-disc decomposition with ProFit on SDSS, KiDS, and future LSST imaging. We find that the biggest increases in fit quality come from moving from SDSS- to KiDS-quality data, with less significant gains moving from KiDS to LSST.},
