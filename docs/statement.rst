GALFIT is a widely used tool for two–dimensional surface–brightness
modeling of galaxies. However, preparing inputs and handling outputs
from GALFIT often involves repetitive manual steps, such as mask
construction, PSF star selection, generation of initial parameters,
and organization of fitting results. These tasks can become
time–consuming and error–prone, particularly in large surveys.

GALFITools provides a set of Python routines that automate and
streamline these tasks. By integrating common pre– and post–processing
steps into a reproducible workflow, GALFITools lowers the technical
barriers for new users and increases efficiency for experienced
researchers. The package is designed for astronomers who analyze
galaxy images and require flexible, scriptable tools that complement
GALFIT analysis.
