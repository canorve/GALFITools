==========
GALFITools
==========


A library for  `GALFIT`_ 

`GALFIT`_, a well-established two-dimensional image fitting algorithm, 
as outlined in the work by Peng et al. (2002, AJ, 124, 266), 
serves as the basis for precise astronomical image surface brightness 
analysis. In pursuit of optimizing the utilization of GALFIT, GALFITools emerges 
as an collection of Python routines. These routines 
enhances the input and output parsing associated with GALFIT.

GALFITools extends its utility through an array of functionalities, 
including the facilitation of mask creation, star selection for PSFs, generation 
of multiple initial parameters, simulate galaxy images, multigaussian 
expansion (MGE) fitting, as well as computation of sky background 
and other pertinent photometric variables.




--------------------------------

**Installation Instructions**
-------------------------------



The python libraries required are:

-  numpy
-  astropy
-  scipy
-  matplotlib
-  mgefit



Install `GALFIT`_ if you haven't done so.


*Optionally*, the establishment of a virtual environment can be considered.


The latest release of GALFITools can be downloaded 
and subsequently installed via one of the following methods:


::

   cd GALFITools 
   pip install . 

or

::

   cd GALFITools 
   python setup.py install


Alternatively, you can install it via pip:


::

   pip install GALFITools 




In conjunction with the installation, a compilation of pertinent 
shell `commands <docs/howto.rst>`__ will be incorporated. Subsequently, a comprehensive 
evaluation of GALFITools' performance can be conducted through 
automated tests using the following procedure:

To run the tests locally, install and invoke tox:

::
   
   pip install tox


run the tests:

::

    tox
